script-generates-sitemap
========================

This is just a simple script which utilizes the https://code.google.com/p/googlesitemapgenerator
download the required file from there and untar it.
paste the script in to the folder and run it.

NB: try to execute the script as root because the sitemap_gen.py inside the source package will use some folders like /var etc. or else editsitemap_gen.py accordingly
